# U-Net-Coursera

### Coursera Deep Learning Specialization Course 4: Convolutional Neural Network

_Week 3 Assignment 2_

This repository provides the answer for coursera deep learning specialization course 4, week 3 assignment 2: Image Segmentation with U-Net. Dataset used here are provided in the course. You can however, use the code for training your own custom dataset, or modify it for other usage.

### U-Net Architecture

### Tensorflow Keras implementation of U-Net

### To Run
- Clone this repository
- Run Image_segmentation_Unet_v2.ipynb on Google Colab (recommended)
- Switch to GPU runtime
- Run each cell and make sure all tests pass :)

### Custom Dataset
- Prepare own images and masks
- In data folder:
  - Replace images in CameraMask with custom images' masks
  - Replace images in CameraRGP with custom images
  - Make sure the images and its corresponding masks have the same name
